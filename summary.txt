Name of Project: Food Environmental Footprint Calculator
Team Number: 50

>>> Project Description

To raise consumersâ€™ awareness of the environmental impacts of their food intake, this program enables the user to generate an Environmental Footprint (EF) report based on his/her food intake. The user selects a food item from a predefined set of food options provided and input weight consumed, and the program then calculates the total EF based on an existing dataset of each food and their EF parameters. A list of recommended food alternatives and possible dishes is generated, and users can choose to receive their results in the form of a PDF via email. Chewpaca the eco-friendly Alpaca guides the user through the entire process.

We used an MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework to breakdown the whole project.
